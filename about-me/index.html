<h2 id="about-me">About me</h2>
<div class="content">
<p>My name is Thomas RAMIREZ, and I am a little more than 25 years old, in this year 2020.
But don't ask me why I choose the Jimskapt nickname, I've no rational reason to give ! 😜</p>

<p>I live in the aera of Nîmes, in Occitannie (south of France), since few years after my birth.</p>
<p>I'm a self-taught software developer for about 10 years, now.</p>

<p>I've started to learn web developpement with curiosity, in (x)HTML4, CSS1, PHP4, and a little bit of Javascript
during my teenage years, mainly thank to courses which was freely available on the <a href="https://www.siteduzero.com/">Site Du Zéro</a>, at the time.</p>

<p>I quickly had the opportunity to practice this new knowledge with developping the website of the
association of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio-controlled_car#Hobby-grade_radio_control_models">RC cars</a>
during a couple of years where I was a member, then the website of the association of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_aircraft#Flying_models_for_sport_(Aeromodeling)">RC aeromodeling</a> where I was also a member
during 2 years, after swapping my RC cars with an helicopter and then planes.</p>
<p>It was dynamic website I design with back-office from scratch (the use of <code>frameworks</code> was not really an habit at this moment).
It was a kind of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system">C.M.S.</a> but made to measure, basically.</p>
<p>A particularity of the RC car website was that we regularly published written coverages of the different
league races in which we took part (about ten per year), with many pictures.</p>

<p>I then decided to stop modelism to focus on my scientific and then technical studies on general mechanics,
where I learn how to design and build mechanical systems.</p>
<p>When I was a student, on my free-time, I also learned and practice during few years the Java 7 and then 8,
again mainly thank to the <a href="https://www.siteduzero.com/">Site Du Zéro</a>.
I also learn C, C++ and Python basis, but I was less <em>hooked</em>.</p>
<p>I finished my last year of study in a <em>Vocational Bachelor’s Degree in Industrial Design</em> in alternating
work-study, with <em>Computer-Aided Design</em> specialization.</p>
<p>So I worked for one year in work-study alternate in a Design Office as an design/draftman, with close connection
with manufacturing (machining, sheet-metal) and assembly workshops.
Then my passion and skills in computer science were spotted and the company offered me to continue to work for
it to ensure maintenance of its (growing) computer park, and especially to deploy and customize a software for
the management and broadcasting of information inside the company : a

<p>I still curious about mechanics.
For exemple, I am actively interested in aeronautics, aerospace, 3D printing, and technical sciences in general.
The discipline that attracts me the most is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechatronics"><em>mechatronics</em></a>,
that means the discipline between mechanics, computers and electronics.</p>

<p>Today, I have the luck to continue to learn with practive the computer science in this predominantly mechanical
company that has trusted me for several years, now.</p>

<p>It still learning computer science through passion, especially about software.
I'm a bit less interessed by hardware, although I like to discover the latest hardware improvments from time to time.
I like to take everyday time to process to my <em>technology watch</em> (its became an habit), and thank to that I (re)discovered web
developpement with <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> in 2015, and then <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a> in 2016, with which I played a lot
without building a really tangible product.</p>
<p>In 2017, I discovered the <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/learn">Rust language</a>, and I fell in love with it a few years later
(the learning curve was hard), which led me to
<a href="../translations/french/rust-book-fr">translate in french a big part of the reference book</a>, between mid-2019 and mid-2020.</p>
